A project that investigates how e parameters such as batchsize, number of epochs, and number of nodes influence the Distributed Learning training process. In this project 3 models are created.
	1. Utilization prediction model (assuming no queueing)
	2. Response time model (assiming M/M/1 queue)
	3. Waiting time model  (assiming M/M/1 queue)
